                          data file, which comes from the JSON encoded header
                          in the data file.
        self.description = string that is the text box from data taking GUI
        self.raw_data = raw data output by measurement software, wavelength vs.
                        data, errors. There may be text for some of the entries
                        corresponding to text used for Origin imports, but they
                        should appear as np.nan
        self.ccd_data = semi-processed 1600 x 3 array of photon energy vs. data
                        with standard error of mean at that pixel calculated by
                        taking multiple images. Standard error is calculated
                        from the data collection software

        Most subclasses should make a self.proc_data, which will do whatever
        processing is required to the ccd_data, such as normalizing, taking
        ratios, etc.
