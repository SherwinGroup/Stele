# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../..'))


# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = 'Stele'
copyright = '2020, Cameron Cannon'
author = 'Cameron Cannon'

# The major project version, used as the replacement for |version|.
version = '0.1'
# The full project version, used as the replacement for |release|.
# Includes alpha/beta/rc tags.
release = '0.1a2'


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# The file extensions of source files.
# Sphinx considers the files with this suffix as sources.
# The value can be a dictionary mapping file extensions to file types.

}

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.

# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
